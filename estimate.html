                        <h2>Data-collection instrument: online Card-Sorting Game</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">Brockman &amp; Jones will need a way to engage with and collect feedback from stakeholders. In order to maximize participation from a diverse array of public and private sector stakeholders, an easy-to-use instrument for gathering feedback can exist.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
   This instrument for gathering input will exist in the format of a Card-Sorting Game.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top45">The card-sorting game works as follows:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Consultants create a deck of "cards". Each card asks a question or makes a statement.</li>
                            <li>Baskets that represent a rating-scale are created for each card. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The rating scale can be qualitative (excellent, moderate, poor).
                                        <br>The rating scale can be quantitative (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
                                        <br>The rating scale can be boolean (yes, no).
                                    </li>                                     
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Participants are asked to put their cards into the baskets as they see fit.
                                <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>When a participant places a card into a basket, the participant is shown how their response compares to the responses of all participants who sorted that same card.
                                <br>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="margin-top45">The card-sorting game is a good fit for the following reasons:&nbsp;</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                It can be easily converted into a static multiple-choice survey where a traditional survey is more appropriate.
</li>
                            <li>It can collect quantitative, qualitative, and boolean data in a structured manner for analysis.</li>
                            <li>Instant live-polling is more engaging to the participant than a survey that simply collects information without giving feedback.</li>
                            <li>Participants deal with one card at a time. Participants may go further into a long survey when they don't see all of the questions at once.</li>
                            <li>It's simple and easy to use with nearly no learning curve.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="margin-top45">Caution when considering the card-sorting game (disclaimer):&nbsp;</h3>
                        <p>Although this card game can be brought into existence and made readily accessible, there is no guarantee that people will go out of their way to play it. It will take work to make people to go to the game and play it. However, if you're already able to convince people to fill out traditional surveys, then they may find this card game to be a welcome change. Participants may possibly even find it fun, and more engaging than the traditional survey for collecting information.</p>
                        <h2 class="margin-top90">Series of Online Stakeholder Events</h2>
                        <p>Brockman &amp; Jones will need a way to engage with and collect feedback from stakeholders. In order to maximize participation from a diverse array of public and private sector stakeholders, a series of Online Stakeholder Conferences can exist.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The Online Stakeholder Conferences are to utilize live video and/or audio streaming to facilitate engaging discussions between the Consultants and Vocal Stakeholders.&nbsp;Vocal Stakeholders&nbsp;are people who are expected to energize the conversations of these events and have the most input.&nbsp;These events will also give Passive Participants the ability to be counted in attendance and to listen in, while having the opportunity to chime in.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Stakeholders are to be invited to attend and participate in these live online events. Stakeholder invitations will make it clear that these events implicate their futures and that they have the power to influence.</p>
                        <p>These events will be hosted on web-conference platforms such as Google Hangouts. 2-3 events (web-conferences) are suggested in case all of the vocal stakeholders can't make it to the same event. Events will be recorded and accessible afterwards. Transcripts, summaries, or actionable items can be synthesized after the conclusion of the events.</p>
                        <p>A website will need to exist in order to disseminate information about the nature of the conferences and collect RSVP's and preliminary information in order to decide the best dates to hold the web-conferences.</p>
                        <h2 class="margin-top90">Incorporate Visuals and Graphics into Deliverables</h2>
                        <p>Brockman &amp; Jones will need user-friendly visuals and graphics to be incorporated into their deliverables.&nbsp;The final deliverables may benefit from a representative symbol / logo.&nbsp;Their deliverables may also benefit from a consistent overall visual style and hierarchy.</p>
